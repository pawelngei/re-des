## About This Site

This website explores the intersection of permaculture, sociocracy, and solarpunk - three approaches to creating regenerative, sustainable, and equitable communities.

### Permaculture
An ethical, resilient design system that works with natural systems to create abundant environments for people and the planet.

### Sociocracy  
A method of governance that distributes power among equivalents and creates a culture of consent.

### Solarpunk
A movement envisioning and working toward a sustainable future that is equitable, beautiful, and achievable.
